 *
 * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common
 * subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
 * with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative
 * order of the remaining characters.
 *
 *
 * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 *
 *
 * A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both
 * strings.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
 * text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

  // 求：最长公共子序列的长度
  //一个字符串的 子序列 是指这样一个新的字符串：它是由原字符串在不改变字符的相对顺序的情况下删除某些字符（也可以不删除任何字符）后组成的新字符串。
  // 例如，"ace" 是 "abcde" 的子序列，但 "aec" 不是 "abcde" 的子序列。
  // 两个字符串的 公共子序列 是这两个字符串所共同拥有的子序列。
